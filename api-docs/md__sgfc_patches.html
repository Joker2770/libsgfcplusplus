<div class="contents">
<div class="textblock"><p>libsgfc++ applies a number of patches to the original SGFC source code to make it more suitable in a software library context. SGFC is quite unusable as a library without these modifications, because many of its routines are designed for command line usage.</p>
<p>This document lists all patches, outlines <b>what</b> changes that are made in each patch and provides an explanation <b>why</b> the changes are made.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> The patches are incremental. The patch files have a numeric prefix that makes it easy to apply them in the correct order.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md43"></a>
How to apply the patches</h1>
<p>The patches were created with <code>git diff</code>. To apply them use <code>git apply</code>. The following shell script snippet applies the patches in the correct order:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">cd sgfc</div>
<div class="line">for PATCH_FILE in ../patch/*; do</div>
<div class="line">  git apply &quot;$PATCH_FILE&quot;</div>
<div class="line">done</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md44"></a>
001-util.c-extern-c.patch</h1>
<p>This patch adds the following <code>extern "C"</code> declaration to <code>util.c</code>:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">extern &quot;C&quot;</div>
<div class="line">{</div>
<div class="line">#include &quot;all.h&quot;</div>
<div class="line">#include &quot;protos.h&quot;</div>
<div class="line">}</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>The reason for this is so that <code>util.c</code> can be be compiled as C++ code (e.g. <code>clang -x c++</code>), but the rest of the SGFC source code can remain being compiled as C code. As a reminder, an <code>extern "C"</code> declaration forces the function names it surrounds to have C linkage (i.e. the compiler does not mangle the names) although the code is compiled by a C++ compiler. Also cf. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/1041880/1054378">this StackOverflow answer</a>.</p>
<p>Compiling <code>util.c</code> as C++ code is necessary first and foremost because the call to <code>exit()</code> needs to be replaced with a statement that throws an exception - and exceptions are a C++ feature. This replacement occurs in the next patch.</p>
<p>Allowing C++ constructs also makes life much easier for later patches.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md45"></a>
002-util.c-throw.patch</h1>
<p>This patch replaces the call to <code>exit()</code> in <code>util.c</code> within the function <code>PrintError()</code> with a statement that throws an exception. The new code looks like this:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">if((type &amp; M_ERROR_TYPE) == E_FATAL_ERROR)      /* fatal one? */</div>
<div class="line">{</div>
<div class="line">       throw std::runtime_error(&quot;PrintError() called with fatal error&quot;);</div>
<div class="line">}</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>The reason for this change is that a software library must never invoke <code>exit()</code> to abort program execution - this is the prerogative of the program that makes use of the library.</p>
<p>Throwing a C++ exception is the best replacement for invoking <code>exit()</code> because it stops code execution and allows the exception to propagate up the call stack until it can be caught by the calling code in libsgfc++.</p>
<p>Adding a return value to <code>PrintError()</code> to achieve the same effect is a doomed effort, because it not only requires a change to every <code>PrintError()</code> call site to handle the return value, but also to every function that somehow ends up indirectly calling <code>PrintError()</code>.</p>
<p><b>Important:</b> Throwing a C++ exception from a C function (functions declared with <code>extern "C"</code>) is not something that just works naturally. Compilers on the different platforms usually have an option that tells them that C functions are allowed to throw C++ exceptions. This causes the compiler to generate code that allows catching those exceptions. For example the MSVC compiler option is <code>/EHs</code>. Details can be found in the project's main <code>CMakeLists.txt</code>.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md46"></a>
003-util.c-messagestream.patch</h1>
<p>This patch changes the <code>PrintError()</code> function so that it pours the output it generates into an <code>std::stringstream</code> instead of printing it to standard output. The patch also changes all other places in the SGFC source code that use <code>fprintf()</code> to write directly to standard output to instead call a new global function <code>WriteFormattedStringToLibSgfcPlusPlusMessageStream()</code>. As its name says, that function redirects the input it receives to the same <code>std::stringstream</code> that is also filled by <code>PrintError()</code>.</p>
<p>The patch then adds global functions that can be called from libsgfc++ to acquire the content of the stream after an SGFC operation, and to reset the stream to prepare SGFC for another operation.</p>
<p>In summary, the changes in this patch enable libsgfc++ to make the SGFC output available to the library client in a structured way so that the client can programmatically evaluate the output e.g. for error handling purposes. libsgfc++ parses the stream content after acquiring it and generates <code>ISgfcMessage</code> objects from the parsed content. libsgfc++ also examines the message types of the <code>ISgfcMessage</code> objects to emulate the exit code that SGFC would terminate with when invoked on the command line (cf. <code>SgfcExitCode</code> enumeration).</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> A solution that sends individual messages back to libsgfc++ for parsing has been considered, but found to be more difficult to implement because then it would be necessary to decide when a message ends and the next one begins. This is non-trivial, because SGFC has been designed so that one call to <code>PrintError()</code> can generate only a partial message, i.e. a full message might need several <code>PrintError()</code> calls. Sometimes <code>PrintError()</code> even calls itself recursively.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md47"></a>
004-main.c-parseargs.patch</h1>
<p>This patch changes the <code>ParseArgs()</code> function so that it is no longer a static function local to <code>main.c</code>, but instead becomes a global function that is callable from libsgfc++. This includes adding the function prototype to <code>protos.h</code> to make it visible to libsgfc++.</p>
<p>The goal is that the library client can programmatically pass arguments to SGFC just as a user would do when invoking SGFC on the command line.</p>
<p>A small but important change that is also included in this patch is that <code>ParseArgs()</code> no longer treats a missing input file argument as a fatal error. This change is necessary so that libsgfc++ can invoke <code>SaveSGF()</code> without a prior call to <code>LoadSGF()</code>.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md48"></a>
005-resetglobalvariables.patch</h1>
<p>This patch adds a number of global functions, each of which is responsible for resetting a few global and <code>static</code> variables that are local to the file in which the reset function is located. For instance, <code>ResetGlobalVariablesInSave()</code> is responsible for resetting variables within <code>save.c</code>.</p>
<p>It is vital that libsgfc++ is capable of resetting SGFC's global state so that the library can invoke SGFC operations many times.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md49"></a>
006-nomainfunction.patch</h1>
<p>This patch removes SGFC's <code>main()</code> function. In a library context the definition of a <code>main()</code> function is reserved for the library client.</p>
<p>Actually the patch makes use of an SGFC feature that already envisions someone else providing a <code>main()</code> function: The patch simply defines the preprocessor macro <code>VERSION_NO_MAIN</code>. This causes the <code>main()</code> function in <code>main.c</code> to not be compiled.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md50"></a>
007-removedestinationfilenamelengthlimit.patch</h1>
<p>The original SGFC code has a limit how long destination file names (including file system path) can be. The maximum is 480 characters. The limit exists merely because a character buffer is hardcoded to a size of 500.</p>
<p>This patch removes that limit.</p>
<p>Because the patch also adds C++ features (try/catch) to the code in <code>save.c</code> that file now needs to be compiled as C++ code. To achieve that the patch adds the same <code>extern "C"</code> declaration to <code>save.c</code> that is added to <code>util.c</code> by <code>001-util.c-extern-c.patch</code>.</p>
<p>The patch adds a different limit instead: When option <code>-s</code> is used for splitting games, there is now a maximum number of games that can be split. The limit is a compile time constant. the default limit is 999999 games, but it can be changed by defining the preprocessor macro MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_GAMES. The value must fit into an <code>int</code> type.</p>
<p>Before the patch there was a theoretical limit of 999999999999999 (15 digits) games that could be split before the sprintf() string formatting would exceed the string buffer limit and cause a buffer overrun. In practice this limit was unreachable because the counter variable of type int would overflow to a negative number before reaching that number.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md51"></a>
008-split-loadsgf.patch</h1>
<p>The function <code>LoadSGF()</code> originally consists of two distinct parts:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Load a file's content into a character buffer and configure the <code>SGFInfo</code> structure with that buffer.</li>
<li>Process the character buffer in preparation for invoking <code>ParseSGF()</code>; this can be seen as stage 1 of the parsing process.</li>
</ol>
<p>This patch splits off the second part into a new function <code>LoadSGFFromFileBuffer()</code> and makes that function available for calling to libsgfc++. This eliminates the constraint that SGFC can only process SGF data loaded from a file and instead allows libsgfc++ to inject arbitrary content into the SGFC parsing process.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md52"></a>
009-save.c-savestream.patch</h1>
<p>This patch follows a similar concept as <code>003-util.c-messagestream.patch</code>: It modifies all functions that are invoked directly or indirectly from <code>SaveSGF()</code> to send their output to an <code>std::stringstream</code> instead of writing it to a <code>FILE</code> handle.</p>
<p>The patch also modifies <code>SaveSGF()</code> so that when the function has finished writing to a file it invokes a function <code>CaptureSaveStreamContent()</code> newly introduced by the patch, to capture a snapshot of the stream. This also associates the snapshot with the file name that SGFC would have used.</p>
<p>The patch finally adds global functions that can be called from libsgfc++ after it receives back control from <code>SaveSGF()</code> to get hold of the captured SGF content and the associated file names. libsgfc++ can then process the SGF content as requested by the library client.</p>
<p>The changes in this patch are important so that libsgfc++ does not have to go through the file system to acquire SGF content saved by SGFC</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md53"></a>
010-const-declarations.patch</h1>
<p>This patch adds the <code>const</code> keyword to some function parameter declarations. The purpose of the change is to avoid a number of these compiler warnings:</p>
<blockquote class="doxtable">
<p>ISO C++11 does not allow conversion from string literal to 'char *' </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Without the modification the warnings occur because <code>New_PropValue()</code> is invoked several times with a string literal argument. Once <code>New_PropValue()</code> has been changed to accept a <code>const char*</code> parameter, the change must be propagated to functions called directly or indirectly from <code>New_PropValue()</code>. </p>
