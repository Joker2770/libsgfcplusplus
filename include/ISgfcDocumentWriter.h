  /// @brief The ISgfcDocumentWriter interface provides functions to generate
  /// SGF data from ISgfcDocument objects and to either write that data to the
  /// filesystem or make it available as an in-memory string.
  /// ISgfcDocumentWriter operates the SGFC backend to achieve its task. Use
  /// SgfcPlusPlusFactory to construct new ISgfcDocumentWriter objects.
  ///
  /// @ingroup public-api
  /// @ingroup sgfc-frontend
  /// @ingroup document
  ///
  /// Before ISgfcDocumentWriter can invoke the SGFC backend's write function
  /// it generates SGF data from the ISgfcDocument whose content should be
  /// written, then passes the SGF data through the SGFC backend's load/parse
  /// functions for data validation. For this to work ISgfcDocumentWriter has
  /// to perform escaping of characters in the SGF data that are also used for
  /// the SGF skeleton. See the SGF specification if you don't know what
  /// "escaping" is about.
  ///
  /// As the SGF skeleton is made up of ASCII characters only, the characters
  /// that require escaping are all ASCII characters. But the SGF standard
  /// allows SgfcSimpleText and SgfcText property values to have a non-ASCII
  /// character encoding. ISgfcDocumentWriter doesn't care about the actual
  /// character encoding that is in use, it simply scans property values for
  /// characters to escape on the byte level. This means that the character
  /// encoding used for property values of type SgfcSimpleText and SgfcText
  /// must be a character encoding that is "ASCII-safe".
  ///
  /// ASCII-safe means:
  /// - The character encoding must encode ASCII characters with their single
  ///   byte values from the ASCII table; and
  /// - The character encoding must not use the byte values of ASCII characters
  ///   to encode anything else but ASCII characters.
  ///
  /// For instance, the ASCII character "]" has the hex value 0x5d in the ASCII
  /// table. The character encoding must therefore use 0x5d to encode the
  /// character "]", and it must guarantee that, regardless of what else is
  /// encoded, the value 0x5d does not appear anywhere in the encoded byte
  /// stream except to encode the character "]".
  ///
  /// Single-byte character encodings such as the ISO-8859 family usually are
  /// ASCII-safe because they have been designed like that. Multi-byte
  /// encodings, however, should not be considered ASCII-safe unless they are
  /// known to be. Big5 and Shift_JIS are notable examples that are @b not
  /// ASCII-safe - see SgfNotes.md for concrete details. UTF-8 is a notable
  /// example that @b is ASCII-safe.
  ///
  /// As already mentioned ISgfcDocumentWriter passes the SGF data it has
  /// generated and escaped to the SGFC backend's load/parse functions, using
  /// the arguments that GetArguments() returns at that point. The processing
  /// is almost exactly the same as when ISgfcDocumentReader had been used to
  /// read the SGF data. If the library client does not do anything special,
  /// this is the default behahviour:
  /// - #SgfcArgumentType::EncodingMode 1 is used.
  /// - The first CA property value determines the encoding to use.
  /// - UTF-8 is used as the default encoding if there is no CA property value.
  ///
  /// The last point is the only difference to ISgfcDocumentReader, which uses
  /// ISO-8859-1 as the default encoding. ISgfcDocumentWriter uses UTF-8 because
  /// it assumes that library clients work with UTF-8. A library client that
  /// wants a different default encoding must change the arguments returned by
  /// GetArguments().
