  /// @brief The ISgfcDocumentReader interface provides functions to generate
  /// ISgfcDocument objects by reading SGF data from the filesystem or from
  /// in-memory data. ISgfcDocumentReader operates the SGFC backend to achieve
  /// its task. Use SgfcPlusPlusFactory to construct new ISgfcDocumentReader
  /// objects.
  ///
  /// @ingroup public-api
  /// @ingroup sgfc-frontend
  /// @ingroup document
  ///
  /// ISgfcDocumentReader invokes the SGFC backend's load/parse functions using
  /// the arguments that GetArguments() returns. If the library client does not
  /// do anything special, this is the default behaviour:
  /// - #SgfcArgumentType::EncodingMode 1 is used.
  /// - The first CA property value found in the SGF data determines the
  ///   encoding to use.
  /// - #SgfcArgumentType::DefaultEncoding ISO-8859-1 is used if there is no
  ///   CA property value.
  ///
  /// When #SgfcArgumentType::EncodingMode 1 or 2 are used the SGFC backend
  /// converts the SGF data it reads into memory to UTF-8. However, without
  /// further measures the document object tree would still contain whatever
  /// CA property values were found in the SGF data. If these values are not
  /// UTF-8 then the document object tree would now contain wrong information
  /// about the encoding used in-memory. This would be a problem if, for
  /// instance, the document object tree were passed to ISgfcDocumentWriter,
  /// because the writer would then use the wrong CA property values. To avoid
  /// this situation ISgfcDocumentReader performs the following manipulations
  /// of the document object tree after the read operation is complete:
  /// - If #SgfcArgumentType::EncodingMode 1 or 2 were used for reading
  ///   ISgfcDocumentReader writes the CA property value "UTF-8" into the root
  ///   node of each ISgfcGame it finds in the document. Only the root node
  ///   needs to be treated such because the CA property is a root property
  ///   which according to the SGF standard is only allowed in the root node.
  ///   Note that the SGFC backend deletes any CA properties that it finds
  ///   outside of a root node.
  /// - If #SgfcArgumentType::EncodingMode 3 was used for reading
  ///   ISgfcDocumentReader does not write a CA property value because the SGF
  ///   data was read into memory as-is.
