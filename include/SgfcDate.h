    ///   mandates that shortcuts acquire the last preceding YYYY and MM.
    /// - Step 2: The date is compared to the preceding date in @a gameDates to
    ///   check whether the shortcut is valid according to the encoding rules in
    ///   the SGF standard. Example: 2020-01-01 followed by the shortcut
