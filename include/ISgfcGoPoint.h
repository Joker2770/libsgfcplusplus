  /// A point on a Go board is an intersection of two lines. A point's location
  /// is identified by a position in a two-dimensional coordinate system. The
  /// horizontal axis is the x-axis, sometimes also called column. The vertical
  /// axis is the y-axis, sometimes also called row.
  ///
  /// ISgfcGoPoint has getter methods that make the point location available
  /// as numeric values in several coordinate systems (enumerated in
  /// SgfcCoordinateSystem). There are two getter methods: One for the x-axis
  /// position and one for the y-axis position. Both provide 1-based values.
  ///
  /// In addition ISgfcGoPoint has getter methods that make the point location
  /// available as string values in several notations (enumerated in
  /// SgfcGoPointNotation). There are three getter methods:
  /// - One getter method that provides the location as a single string value.
  /// - And two getter methods that provide the x-axis and y-axis compounds of
  ///   the location, respectively, as two separate string values.
