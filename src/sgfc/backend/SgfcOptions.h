  /// Some notes about the internal workings of SGFC:
  /// - An SGFCOptions struct is part of the SGFInfo struct that is passed as
  ///   a parameter to all major SGFC functions, including ParseArgs(). Thus
  ///   the option values are available everywhere in SGFC.
  /// - When SGFInfo is created/initialized with SetupSGFInfo() a custom
  ///   SGFCOptions object can be passed as a parameter. SetupSGFInfo() uses
  ///   this to populate the SGFInfo object. This is the mechanism how an
  ///   SGFCOptions with arbitrary values can be injected into SGFC.
  /// - When SetupSGFInfo() receives no custom SGFCOptions object, it invokes
  ///   the SGFC global function SGFCDefaultOptions() to construct a new
  ///   SGFCOptions object with default values. SGFCDefaultOptions() can also
  ///   be invoked outside of the context of SetupSGFInfo().
  /// - When ParseArgs() is invoked it parses the command line arguments that
  ///   are specified as a parameter and populates the SGFCOptions object
  ///   inside the SGFInfo object with values that result from these parsing
  ///   activities. The purpose of the SgfcOptions class is to capture the
  ///   values in such an SGFCOptions object.
  class SgfcOptions
