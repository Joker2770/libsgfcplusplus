    ///   ISgfcSinglePropertyValue objects' HasTypedValue() method returns false
    ///   and the GetTypeConversionErrorMessage() method returns a message that
    ///   describes the reason for the conversion failure.
    /// - If SgfcPropertyDecoder succeeds to convert the raw string value, the
    ///   ISgfcSinglePropertyValue objects' HasTypedValue() method returns true
    ///   and one of the numerous To...() methods can be used to cast the
    ///   object to a concrete type.

    /// @exception std::domain_error Is thrown if something about the SGF
    /// property object passed to the constructor is not as expected. This
    /// exception should never be thrown, but when it @b is thrown this is an
    /// indicator for an interfacing problem with SGFC. The exception is known
    /// to be thrown in the following cases: 1) Any value type is expected, but
    /// the SGF property object does not contain a value. 2) A single value type
    /// is expected, but the SGF property object also contains a second value.
    /// 3) A composed value type is expected, but the SGF property object
    /// contains no second value.
    ///
    /// @note This method relies on certain pre-processing performed by SGFC.
    /// Notably:
    /// - SGFC is expected to trim leading and trailing whitespace from values
    ///   that are not SimpleText or Text. Without trimming this method would
    ///   be unable to recognize Double and Color values.
    /// - In SimpleText values, SGFC is expected to convert whitespace
    ///   characters other than space to space (i.e. line breaks are not
    ///   preserved). Due to shortcomings in SGFC's handling of line breaks
    ///   this method adds its own line break handling, so currently SGFC's
    ///   line break handling is irrelevant to the implementation of this
    ///   method. See the next note for details.
    /// - In Text values, SGFC is expected to convert whitespace characters
    ///   other than line breaks are converted to space (i.e. line breaks are
    ///   preserved). SGFC is also expected to remove escaped line breaks.
    ///   Due to shortcomings in SGFC's handling of line breaks this method
    ///   adds its own line break handling, so currently SGFC's line break
    ///   handling is irrelevant to the implementation of this method.
    ///   See the next note for details.
    /// - In SimpleText and Text values, all unnecessary escape characters
    ///   are removed. E.g. escaping the "a" character is not necessary, so
    ///   when SGFC sees "\a" it removes the unnecessary escape character and
    ///   this method gets to process only "a". In short, this method does not
    ///   perform any escape character handling.
    /// - In Move values, if the game type is Go and the board size is <= 19x19,
    ///   SGFC is expected to convert the value "tt" to an empty string.
    ///   According to the SGF standard an empty string and value "tt" both
    ///   express a pass move, but in FF4 the "tt" representation is kept only
    ///   for compatibility with FF3.
    ///
    /// @note This method has its own line break handling for SimpleText and
    /// Text values, due to two shortcomings in SGFC: 1) A bug in SGFC: If a
    /// SimpleText value is the second value of a composed value then SGFC does
    /// not detect and remove hard and soft line breaks in all cases. This
    /// method is capable of detecting these cases. 2) SGFC only handles one
    /// kind of line break (e.g. LF, CRLF, ...) in SimpleText and Text values:
    /// The one that was predetermined at compile time. This method is capable
    /// of recognizing and handling all kinds of platform-specific line breaks.
    ///
    /// @note If SgfcPropertyDecoder was constructed with SgfcGameType::Go
    /// the decoding process performs the following game logic validation:
    /// - If SgfcPropertyDecoder was constructed with
    ///   SgfcConstants::BoardSizeNone or SgfcConstants::BoardSizeInvalid, any
    ///   game-specific property value objects (e.g. ISgfcGoPointPropertyValue)
    ///   that would normally contain an ISgfcGoPoint do not contain such an
    ///   object. Instead they contain the raw property value only.
    /// - If SgfcPropertyDecoder was constructed with a valid board size but
    ///   the property value contains a location that is outside the boundaries
    ///   of the specified board size, any game-specific property value objects
    ///   (e.g. ISgfcGoPointPropertyValue) that would normally contain an
    ///   ISgfcGoPoint do not contain such an object. Instead they contain the
    ///   raw property value only.
