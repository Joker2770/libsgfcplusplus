This SGF file demonstrates various things related to compressed point lists
- The first game tree has game type 1, i.e. Go. This demonstrates two things:
  - A Point list (MA property) is automatically uncompressed.
  - A Stone list (AB property) is automatically uncompressed, too. The reason
    for this is that Go doesn't have a distinguishable set of game pieces, so
    according to the SGF standard the Stone value type is reduced to the Point
    value type. A Stone list therefore becomes a Point list.
- The second game tree has game type that is not 1, i.e. not Go. This
  demonstrates two things:
  - A Point list (MA property) is no longer automatically uncompressed, but
    the rectangle corners are made available as two separate Point values of a
    composed value.
  - A Stone list (AB property) is treated just like a Point list, in the same
    way as it happens for Go, so here the rectangle corners are also made
    available as a value composed of two Points. This does not conform to the
    SGF standard because game types other than Go may well have distinguishable
    game pieces.
